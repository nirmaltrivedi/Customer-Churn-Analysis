# Customer-Churn-Analysis

Did Customer Churn Analysis on Telecom company data where end-to-end exploratory data analysis was performed on single and multiple variables. Implemented various classification models on the data and selected Random Forest Classifier due to its high accuracy of 93%. This project is used to predict if a customer is going to churn or not and take useful actions for that respective case.

The following are the tools and libraries we used to build this model:

1. Python language
2. Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3. Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
4. Sklearn for model building
5. Jupyter notebook
